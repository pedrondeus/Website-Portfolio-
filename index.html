            <h2>About Pedro</h2>
              <p>After moving back to United States, I faced a lot of challenges with language and adaptation to the culture, nevertheless I was able to learn a lot from the experiences, and finally decided to get more challenges by getting in the tech industry with Thinkful.</p>
            <p>One of my goals in life is to improve myself as much as I can, so for that reason, I'm open to constructive criticism. My self awareness has led me to great sucess in many goals I set for myself, but sometimes an outside perspective adds up to greatness.</p>
            <p>As a student at <a href="www.thinful.com">Thinkful</a>, coding has become something enjoyable for me, because now I see where I am going.</p>
            <p>If you want to hire someone inquisitive, who wants to improve himself and grow with the team, you found the right one! I'm excited to work with other developers to build great software!</p>
